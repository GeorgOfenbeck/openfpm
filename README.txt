# OpenFPM

OpenFPM is a scalable and open C++ framework for particles and mesh simulation

You can build scalable: Molecular dynamic,SPH, Granular flow,Finite differences, Particle Mesh codes on CPUs and GPUs. We provide examples for each case here. Despite our main interest in simulations the distributed data-structures OpenFPM provides are not limited to simulations. The work is released under BSD 3 clause license.
