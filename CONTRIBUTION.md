Contribution Guidelines for OpenFPM
We appreciate your interest in contributing to the openfpm_pdata project! Before starting, please take a moment to read these guidelines. Following these will help us streamline the collaboration process and maintain the project effectively.

General Guidelines
Code of Conduct: Please follow our Code of Conduct in all your interactions within the project.

Issues: If you find a bug or have a feature request, please check the existing issues first. If it hasn't been reported or requested, feel free to create a new one.

Pull Requests (PR): We follow the "fork-and-pull" workflow. Please create a separate branch in your fork for each feature or fix, instead of using your master branch. This way, you can submit a pull request (PR) for each feature or fix, which makes the review process simpler.

Contributing to Submodules
The openfpm_pdata project includes several submodules, like openfpm_numerics and others. If you want to contribute to these, please follow the guidelines below:

Submodule Branch: Create a new branch for each feature or fix in the respective submodule. Use the following pattern for your branch names: fix/issue-short-description or feat/feat-short-description .

Pull Requests for Submodules: If you're submitting a PR for a submodule, make sure to initiate the PR to the submodule's repository and not to the main openfpm_pdata repository. This helps keep the project's version control history clean and easy to follow.

Linking PRs: If your PR for a submodule is related to an issue in the main openfpm_pdata repository, please include a link to that issue in the PR description. This will help us understand the context of the changes you've made.

Pull Request Process
Update README: If your changes involve adding or modifying functionality, ensure the README.md file is updated accordingly.

Code Documentation: Please document and comment your code. It helps others understand the purpose of your code and makes maintenance easier.

Testing: Make sure your changes pass all existing tests before submitting a PR. If you add new functionality, please also add appropriate tests.

Code Review: After submitting a PR, one of the project maintainers will review it. They may suggest some changes or improvements. Please don't be disheartened if this happens; it's a standard part of the process.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenFPM! We look forward to working with you and building a better project together.
